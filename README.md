# peaks-visualization

This repo contains the code for visualizing peaks in MINT-generated metabolomics data. The idea of this notebook is to generate the graphics of peaks on a small set of samples for optimizing retention times windows before running MINT over a larger number of samples. 

The table used in this repo was generated with the full results option of the MINT program (https://mint.resistancedb.org/)
